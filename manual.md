# Getting started

### When the ss gets too big
We recommend the following:
1. On Desktop version in browser: File -> Make a copy.
This will be your backup copy of old jobs. It doesn't have triggers so won't run in the background but has all the data and settings saved.
2. Disable checking
3. In the address bar (Ctrl+J) enter `3:1000`
Wait a little until it makes the selection of all rows from 3 to the end
4. Right click on the selected row  numbers - Delete rows

Now you have a fresh new spreadsheet with only two data rows. These few rows are necessary to copy the formatting from them to newly added rows with new jobs.
That's it - you have a clean spreadsheet with all you present settings and triggers ready to open a new page on Upwork
