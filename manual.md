## Getting started

### When the spreadsheet gets too big
We recommend the following:
1. On Desktop version in the browser: File -> Make a copy.

This will be your backup copy of old jobs. It doesn't have triggers so won't run in the background but has all the data and settings saved.

2. Disable checking
3. Select any cell, then pres Ctrl+A two times to select the whole sheet, then create a filter. In the filter HIDE all the rows that you want to keep (star = 'Starred', Status = 'Applied', etc.) the rest of the rows will be deleted
4. In the address bar (Ctrl+J) it's located to the left from the formula bar, enter `3:1000`. You may need to wait a little until it makes the selection of all rows from 3 to 1000.
5. Right click on the selected row  numbers - Delete rows 3 - 1000
6. Repeat step 5 until all rows after 2 are deleted.

Now you have a fresh new spreadsheet with only two data rows. These few rows are necessary to copy the formatting from them to newly added rows with new jobs.
That's it - you have a clean spreadsheet with all you present settings and triggers ready to open a new page on Upwork
