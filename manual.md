# Getting started

### When the spreadsheet gets too big
We recommend the following:
1. On Desktop version in the browser: File -> Make a copy.
This will be your backup copy of old jobs. It doesn't have triggers so won't run in the background but has all the data and settings saved.
2. Disable checking
3. In the address bar (Ctrl+J) it's located to the left from the formula bar, enter `3:1000`
Wait a little until it makes the selection of all rows from 3 to 1000
4. Right click on the selected row  numbers - Delete rows 3 - 1000
5. Repeat step 4 until all rows after 2 are deleted.

Now you have a fresh new spreadsheet with only two data rows. These few rows are necessary to copy the formatting from them to newly added rows with new jobs.
That's it - you have a clean spreadsheet with all you present settings and triggers ready to open a new page on Upwork
